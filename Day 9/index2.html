                        <h2>Introduction to C++</h2>
                    <p>
            C++is a powerful general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s. C++ is widely used for system/software development, game development, and applications that require high performance.</p>
                        <h3>Features of C++</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Object-Oriented: C++ supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, allowing for the creation of classes and objects. This helps in organizing code and promoting reusability.</li>
                            <li>Rich Standard Library: C++ provides a rich set of built-in functions and libraries, which can significantly reduce the development time.</li>
                            <li>Performance: C++ offers low-level memory manipulation, allowing developers to optimize performance-critical applications. </li>
                            <li>Portability: C++ programs can be compiled and run on various platforms without significant modifications.</li>
                            <li>Compatibility with C: C++ is compatible with C, allowing for the integration of existing C code.</li>

            <pre style="background-color: azure;">
                #include &lt;iostream&gt;
                using namespace std;

                int main() 
                {
                    cout << "Hello, World!";
                    return 0;
                }
            </pre>
                            
                        </code>
                        <ul>
                            <li>#include &lt;iostream&gt; This includes the input/output stream library, allowing the use of cout for output and cin for input.</li>
                            <li>using namespace std;: This line allows access to the standard library features without prefixing them with std::</li>
                            <li>int main(): The entry point of every C++ program.</li>
                            <li>cout: Used for outputting data to the console.</li>
                            <li>return 0;: Indicates that the program has ended successfully.</li>
                        </ul>

         <h2>Introduction to Arrays</h2>
         <h3>What is an Array ?</h3>
         <p>
An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, typically of the same data type. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, which allows for efficient data management and manipulation.</p>
            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240410101419/Getting-Started-with-Array-Data-Structure.webp" alt="array image" width="900px" height="500px">
            <h3>Characteristics of Arrays</h3>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed Size: The size of an array is defined when it is created and cannot be changed.</li>
                <li>Indexed: Each element in an array is accessed using an index, which typically starts from 0.</li>
                <li>Homogeneous Elements: All elements in an array must be of the same data type, such as integers, floats, or strings.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Types of Arrays</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    One-Dimensional Arrays: A linear list of elements, where each element can be accessed by a single index. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: int numbers[5]; (stores 5 integers)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Multi-Dimensional Arrays: Arrays with more than one dimension, commonly used for matrices and tables.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: int matrix[3][3]; (a 3x3 matrix of integers)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dynamic Arrays: Arrays that can change size during program execution, typically implemented using data structures like lists.
                </li>

         <h2>Introduction to Trees:</h2>
         <p>
            
A tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Each tree has a single root node at the top, from which all other nodes branch out. Nodes can have zero or more child nodes, and each child node can further branch out into more nodes. Trees are commonly used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as file systems or organizational structures.
         </p>

         <h3>Characteristics of Trees</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Root Node: The topmost node in a tree, which has no parent.</li>
            <li>Child Node: A node that is a descendant of another node.</li>
            <li>Parent Node: A node that has one or more child nodes.</li>
            <li>Leaf Node: A node that has no children.</li>
            <li>Depth: The number of edges from the root node to a specific node.</li>
            <li>Height: The number of edges on the longest path from a node to a leaf.</li>
            
         </ul>
         <h3>Types of Trees</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Binary Tree : Every node has at most two children</li>
            <li>Ternary Tree : Every node has at most three children</li>
            <li>N-ary Tree : Every node has at most n children.</li>
         </ol>
         <h3>Application  of Trees</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Store hierarchical data, like folder structure, organization structure, XML/HTML data.</li>
            <li>Binary Search Tree is a tree that allows fast search, insert, delete on a sorted data. It also allows finding closest item</li>

            <h2>Introduction to Graph</h2>
            <p>Graph is a non-linear data structure like tree data structure. The limitation of tree is, it can only represent hierarchical data. For situations where nodes or vertices are randomly connected with each other other, we use Graph.</p>
            <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240403150314/graph-data-structure.webp" alt="graph image">

            <h3>Charactersticks of Grpah</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Vertices (Nodes): The fundamental units of a graph, representing entities in the graph.</li>
                <li>Edges: Connections between pairs of vertices, which can be directed (one-way) or undirected (two-way).</li>
                <li>Degree: The number of edges connected to a vertex. For directed graphs, a vertex can have an in-degree (number of incoming edges) and an out-degree (number of outgoing edges).</li>
                <li>Path: A sequence of edges that connects a sequence of vertices</li>
                <li>Cycle: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex without repeating any edges.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Types of Graph</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Directed Graph (Digraph): A graph where the edges have a direction, indicating the relationship flows from one vertex to another.</li>
                <li>Undirected Graph: A graph where the edges do not have a direction, indicating a two-way relationship between vertices.</li>
                <li>Weighted Graph: A graph where each edge has an associated weight or cost, often used to represent distances or costs in a network.</li>
                <li>Unweighted Graph: A graph where all edges are treated equally, without any weights.</li>
                <li>Cyclic Graph: A graph that contains at least one cycle.</li>
                <li>Acyclic Graph: A graph that does not contain any cycles, such as a tree.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Applications of Graph</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Graphs are used to model many problems and solutions in computer science, such as representing networks, web pages, and social media connections. Graph algorithms are used in pathfinding, data compression, and scheduling.</li>
                <li>Graphs represent and analyze social networks, such as the connections between individuals and groups.</li>
                <li>Graphs can be used to model transportation systems, such as roads and flights, and to find the shortest or quickest routes between locations.</li>
                <li>Graphs can represent and analyze text, such as in syntactic and semantic dependency graphs.</li>
